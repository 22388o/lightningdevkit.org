title: Use Cases for LDK
---

LDK is designed to provide incredible flexibility in integrating a lightning node into your application. It is not designed to be a stand-alone application and those seeking a full lightning node to run may wish to look elsewhere. LDK focuses on ensuring tight integration with existing on-chain wallets is easy, allowing reuse of existing blockchain download, key management, UTXO management, and on-disk/cloud storage. See (Getting Started)[/docs/getting_started#ldk-batteries] for more details on the interfaces LDK provides for integration.
