### [Rust Documentation](https://docs.rs/lightning/0.0.12/lightning/index.html)

These provide the most searchable and comprehensive documentation on LDK.
If you're using Java and want more information on any method/struct/etc., searching
the Rust docs for the Rust version of that struct/method is your best bet.

### [Rust Sample Node](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/rust-lightning-bitcoinrpc)

While this node is a little outdated, it's still a very useful reference for how to construct
a lightning node using LDK.

### [Swift LDK Documentation](https://github.com/arik-so/SwiftLightning/tree/master/Documentation)

These docs are mainly geared towards how Swift could call LDK C bindings directly, but still may
provide a useful overview of Rust Lightning in the context of language bindings.

### [LDK Architecture](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Ql-q5gyrPnJhi7z_D39jayG0HEEVh6UEY1eULXb03Eg/edit?usp=sharing)

Gives a high-level organization of LDK and how the pieces fit together. Variations of this diagram
are used throughout the site. This is the primary source and is still a work in progress.
