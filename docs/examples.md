# Examples

### [Rust Sample Node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample)

The sample serves as a complete reference for constructing a Lightning node with
the LDK. This is a good starting point if you want a self-guided tour!

### [Java Sample Node](https://github.com/getlipa/ldk-sample-java)

This repository contains a sample implementation of LDK as the result of following the steps described in [Building a Node with LDK in Java](/tutorials/build_a_node_in_java/).

### [Kotlin Sample Node](https://github.com/BlueWallet/HelloLightning)

Kotlin based CLI lightning network server based on LDK. Provides HTTP-RPC interface

### [BDK + LDK Sample Node](https://github.com/johncantrell97/bdk-ldk)
